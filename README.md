# Cosmonaut

A WIP pure JS implementation of the BitTorrent protocol, based on work by [@allenkim67](https://github.com/allenkim67)<sup>[1]</sup>. 

TODO:

- [ ] Multi-file downloads
- [ ] Torrent management
- [ ] Completion detection
- [ ] Seeding support
- [ ] Quick resume
- [ ] Concurrent download support
- [ ] User preference management
- [ ] Any kind of usable UI

Plans:

The end goal for this project is to have a user-friendly torrent download + seeding utility, which satisfies my own
needs, and if a userbase develops around this project, I'd be happy to take feature suggestions and work with the *arr
team on getting download client implementations sorted for the [Radarr](https://github.com/Radarr/Radarr)
and [Sonarr](https://github.com/Sonarr/Sonarr) projects

Contributing:

Contributions are welcome, especially criticism and implementation advice, this is my first time working with the
BitTorrent protocol on the implementation side of the engine, so I'd love to be able to learn as much as possible.
